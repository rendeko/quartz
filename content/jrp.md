It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing the indefinite closure of JRP Roleplay.  
  
With the TES3MP community dwindling down and many of our players having moved on, we feel it is time to offer some closure. It has been an amazing 2 years with you all, and we will fondly remember the many stories and memories we made together. We sincerely thank you for spending that time with us.  
(There may be JRP projects in the future, but likely not TES3MP related)  
  
Wealth beyond measure, outlander.
